<h2>Getting Started</h2>


->Our project consists of sign in and login page for students as well for admin.

->Then comes the upcoming events section where the students can login for the events such as Training for Internships, Machine Learning, AR/VR and so on.

->Then it displays the list of current companies where you can apply for the role that you wished for.

->Also, it shows the results of the current rounds of the company.

-> We have also designed statistics of the previous years using chart.js and the user can also download the report of previous years.

->Lastly, we have implemented a chatbot so that the students can ask any questions regarding placement and current companies rounds, tentative dates or package.
